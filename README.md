# JMWCAT
## Japanese Mimetic Word Corpus Analysis Tool

#### What is JMWCAT (Japanese Mimetic Word Corpus Analysis Tool)?
JWMCAT is a simple to use program written in Python which quickly allows a user to take a text with total word frequency generated by cb4960's **Japanese Text Analysis Tool** (https://sourceforge.net/projects/japanesetextana/). By taking the output, selecting a file containing a list of words you would like to search over in your final corpus analysis (mimetic words by default) you are able to quickly and powerfully create datasets for academic analysis. In the future there are plans to make this more featureful, however, for now, it is as is.

#### How to Use?
Just clone the repository and run `python3 analysis.py` and you are good to go!
